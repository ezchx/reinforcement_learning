- Simple example of Q-learning
- Agent moves left or right until it discovers the treasure (T) at the far right
- Discrete actions and states

__(2) cartpole_simple_dqn.ipynb__    
- Similar to (1) except with continuous states - i.e. Q-table is a neural network
- Simulations are saved in a memory object, randomly sampled as a batch, and used to train the neural network
- Epsilon decays every episode to reduce variability as the network trains
- Achieves a reward of 200 at 120 episodes
