(1) [Treasure Hunter](https://github.com/ezchx/reinforcement_learning/blob/master/treasure_hunter.ipynb)    
- Very simple example of Q-learning
- Agent moves left or right until it discovers the treasure (T) at the far right
- Discrete actions and finite # of states

(2) [Cart Pole](https://github.com/ezchx/reinforcement_learning/blob/master/cartpole_simple_dqn.ipynb)    
- Based on (1) above with a neural network for the Q-table
- Simulations are saved in a memory object, randomly sampled as a batch, and used to train the model
- Epsilon decays every episode to reduce variability as the network trains
- Achieves a reward of 200 at 120 episodes

(3) [Mountain Car](https://github.com/ezchx/reinforcement_learning/blob/master/mountain_car_simple_dqn.ipynb)    
- Based on (2) above with mountain car environment and parameters
- Two environments:
    - env = gym.make("MountainCar-v0") - capped at 200 moves
    - env = gym.make("MountainCar-v0").env - unlimited moves
- High learning rate (0.5) and low exploration rate (0.1)
- Total reward above -200 around 100 episodes for the 200 move environment
- Total reward above -200 around 10 episodes for the unlimited environment
